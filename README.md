# rgb_wifi_python
Implementation of the WF-200 (aka LW-12 aka Wifi-370) controller API in a Python script.

These scripts are basic code examples to talk to the controller.
They are minimalistic and even run on Android phones (SL4A).
Apps like Tasker can then e.g. let the LED blink on incoming messages or even dim it according to the cloud cover and weather.

**To change the sent commands you have to replace the one in the script with one from the HEX codes in the Protocol.doc file.**
